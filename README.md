# OSC-Chemometrics
Code and FTIR data used for chemometric treatment of OSC spectroscopic data.

Data Folder:
FTIR spectral datasets for two OSC systems (FBTF and PTB7). Each system was exposed to cumulative intervals of photo-exposure from a solar simulator. FBTF films on two substrates (Ag and ITO) were exposed to 15 minute intervals while PTB7 films on a ZnSe internal reflection element were exposed to 30 minute intervals.

Class Labels:
FBTF:
1 = pristine (Ag)
2 = 15x1 (Ag)
3 = 15x2 (Ag)
4 = 15x3 (Ag)
5 = 15x4 (Ag)
6 = 15x5 (Ag)
7 = 15x6 (Ag)
8 = pristine (ITO)
9 = 15x1 (ITO)
10 = 15x2 (ITO)
11 = 15x3 (ITO)
12 = 15x4 (ITO)
13 = 15x5 (ITO)
14 = 15x6 (ITO)

PTB7:
1 = pristine
2 = 30x1
3 = 30x2
4 = 30x3
5 = 30x4
6 = 30x5
7 = 30x6
8 = 30x7
9 = 30x8
10 = 30x9
11 = 30x10
